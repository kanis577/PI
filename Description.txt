The number π\piπ is a mathematical constant. Defined as the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter.

Given lll and rrr, your task is to output the lthl^{th}lth digit to the rthr^{th}rth digit of π\piπ after decimal point.

The following is a method to approximate π\piπ, called Liu Hui's π\piπ algorithm.

side length of the regular n-sided polygon in unit circle.

    M6=1
    M2n2​=2−sqrt(4−Mn2)
   Dn​ : number of side.
        D6=6
        D2n=2Dn
   An​ : perimeter of regular n-sided polygon in unit circle.
        An=Mn×Dn
        lim n → ∞ An = perimeter of unit circle = 2π2\pi2π

Use (Mn,Dn) to compute (M2n,D2n). The larger n is, the closer π you will get.

special requirement : code length should below 1000 charater or you will get a CE.

On the first line there is a single integer TTT indicating the number of test cases.

Each test case contains two integers lll and rrr described above.

    1≤T≤1000
    1≤l≤r≤10000
    r−l<10

partial score :

    25% : 1≤l≤r≤10
    25% : 1≤l≤r≤100
    25% : 1≤l≤r≤1000
    25% : 1≤l≤r≤10000

Output T lines, the i th line should contain the output of the i th test case.
